I am a forth-year Ph.D. student at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, supervised by Prof.[Xu Chen](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/chenxu). Prior to this, I earned my Master's degree at the School of Information, Renmin University of China, supervised by Prof.[Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=JNhNacoAAAAJ).

My research interests lie in Recommender Systems, with a particular focus on Explainable Recommendation. Recently, I have been exploring the field of LLM-based Agents.

<span style="color: red;"><em><strong>Note:</strong> I am actively seeking job opportunities in both industry and academia, with my expected graduation in June 2026. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested — I’d be happy to chat!</em></span>
