I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Xu Chen](http://xu-chen.com). Prior to this, I earned my M.E. at the School of Information, Renmin University of China, supervised by Prof. [Wayne Xin Zhao](http://playbigdata.ruc.edu.cn/batmanfly/).

My major research interests lie in Recommender Systems, with a particular focus on Explainable Recommendation. Recently, I have been exploring the field of Large Language Model-based Agents.

<span style="color: red;"><em><strong>Note:</strong> I am actively seeking job opportunities in both academia and industry, with my expected graduation in June 2026. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested — I’d be happy to chat!</em></span>
